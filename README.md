## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is included in the repository. It is uploaded using the file upload widget in the Jupyter notebook.

## Linear Regression Model

The notebook demonstrates the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for modeling.
3. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the results and the regression line.

### Results

The notebook includes visualizations of the dataset and the linear regression model. The performance metrics of the model are also displayed.
